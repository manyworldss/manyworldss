- **Greenville County** — built internal tools and support systems to help new employees actually feel supported when they joined.

### What I Care About

I’m here to build things that work for people who need them most. People with dietary restrictions, people with language barriers, people who get overlooked. I bring the technical skills, but the value comes from empathy, curiosity, and honesty. That’s the core of my work — and what I’m trying to get better at every day.
