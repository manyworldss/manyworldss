# Hey, I'm Rapheal Suber

Right now I’m in the middle of a shift. I’ve spent time in backend engineering and cloud systems — but where I really find meaning is in understanding people and building tools that actually help them. Not just work for them, help them.

I care about human behavior, ethical tech, and design.

### Things I've Built

- **Celio** — a multilingual emergency card app for people with celiac disease. Made for travelers like me who are tired of language gaps putting their health at risk.
- **Greenville County** — built internal tools and support systems to help new employees actually feel supported when they joined.

### Tools I Use

**Languages**: Python, SQL, Swift, Bash  
**Backend**: Django, Flask, REST APIs  
**Frontend**: Tailwind CSS, HTMX, a little React  
**DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD  
**Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis  
**UX/Research**: Figma, interviews, personas, accessibility, documentation

### What I Care About

I’m here to build things that work for people who need them most. People with dietary restrictions, people with language barriers, people who get overlooked. I bring the technical skills, but the value comes from empathy, curiosity, and honesty. That’s the core of my work — and what I’m trying to get better at every day.
